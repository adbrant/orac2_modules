Wrapper for ORAC modules for offloading processing to new pd~ process

Process for porting modules:
- Copy the single threaded module into the /module subfolder.
- Replace module.json in the main folder with the one from the original module
- Run ‘python wrapper.py’, and replace params.pd with the newly generated params.new.pd (I think the 	python on the organelle will work)

Does not currently support:
- Graphics
- Modules that output notes
